**Learn More About This Year's Competition: Hunt for the Hologram**

The Hunt:
Hunt for the Hologram hunters use our custom ‘testers’ to try to trap materials in a beam of light.  Particles hunters have already discovered include: printer toner, soot, peanut butter, tiny diamonds (!), paper particles and pollen. Hunters can work as individuals or as teams.  Hunters test items from anywhere.  Hunting teams help each other think of new items to test.

When a hunter finds a particle that traps they first check to make sure it isn’t already on this list of known particles, then they send the particle in a postage-paid envelope to our lab for an official time trial.  Their results appear on the Hunt for the hologram leader board. 


**The Details:**

In the "Hunt for the Hologram" competition, the key scoring objects are diverse particles tested for their capability in Photophoretic trapping. There are an infinite number of particle types available, ranging from everyday materials like peanut butter to rare substances like nano diamonds.

Some particles have already been tested. Check the online database to make sure your particle is new. Each participating school will be given a set of starter particles from the database to get started. Special recognition will be given to particles that are significantly different than particles in the database.

The main objective of the game is to identify the particles that are the most promising particles for holographic projection with your team members. Scoring is based on each particle's frequency and duration of trapping within the beam of light. Depending on the consistency and reliability of particle performance, teams can also secure bonuses such as the Consistency Bonus and Duration Boost.

At the conclusion of the testing period, teams can submit their top-performing particles to BYU's central lab, where they undergo official testing. Successful particles may be incorporated into the prototype 3D projector, shining a light on the team's logo as a mark of acknowledgment.
